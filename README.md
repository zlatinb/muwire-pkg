# MuWire Packaging Project

This is a project for packaging MuWire for various platforms.

You need to have [MuWire] and [I2P] checked out as siblings to this project.

### Building a JRE for MuWire

0. Build I2P with `ant clean pkg`
1. Build MuWire as described in the MuWire README
2. Set JAVA_HOME to your installation of JDK11+
3. Set one or more of the following:
   * JAVA_HOME_WIN - to where the windows jdk installation is
   * JAVA_HOME_MAC - to where the osx jdk installation is
   * JAVA_HOME_LINUX - to where the linux jdk installation is
4. run `jlink.sh`
5. If all goes well, the mini-jvms for each platform will be in the `dist` folder.

Note that compression is disabled because it is assumed that the final redistributable will be compressed using lzma or such.

The file `jlink.modules` contains modules which are forcibly included by jlink.

### Building the Windows installer

##### Option A: On Debian-based systems:

You need to have dos2unix and nsis installed.  Those are usually available on Debian systems

Run `nsis.sh`

##### Option B: on Windows

You need to have the following software:

* JDK 14+
* NSIS
* a bash-like environment, like Git-Bash or Cygwin

Set JAVA_HOME to point to your JDK 14 installation and run `sh jpackage.sh`.  Then go inside the `build` directory, and from there right-click on the `installer-jpackage.nsi` file and select "Compile with NSIS".

### Building the Mac bundle

See `README.md` in the `mac-jpackage` folder.

### Building Linux AppImage

Set the "APPIMAGE_BINARY" to the absolute path of the App Image tool 
(You can download it from https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/releases )

Run `linux.sh`

### Building on armhf/aarch64 (Raspberry Pi)

Same steps as Linux, excpet run `linux-armhf.sh` or `linux-aarch64.sh`
